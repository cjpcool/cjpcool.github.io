## About Me

Jianpeng Chen is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu/) since Aug. 2023, where he is advised by [Prof. Dawei Zhou](https://sites.google.com/view/dawei-zhou/home?authuser=0) in [VLOG Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/dawei-zhou/vlog-lab). During his M.S. degree at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), he was fortunately advised by [Prof. Yazhou Ren](https://yazhou-ren.github.io/) and closely worked with [Prof. Lifang He](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/faculty/lifang-he) on the topic of multi-view/graph learning.

His research generally lies in **data mining** and **machine learning**, with a particular focus on **generative models**, **graph learning**, unsupervised **multi-view/modal/graph learning**, as well as their applications in scientific domains, (e.g., 3D graph modeling of **metamaterials** and **molecules**, etc.), contributing to the broader fields of **AI for science**.

## Research Interests

- **Data Mining:** Graph learning, Multi-modal/view/graph learning, Geometric generation
- **AI for Science:** Metamaterial discovery, Molecular dynamic simulation
