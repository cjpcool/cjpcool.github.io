## About Me

Jianpeng Chen is currently a PhD student at [VLOG Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/dawei-zhou/vlog-lab) from the department of computer science **Virginia Tech**, and is fortunately advised by [Prof. Dawei Zhou](https://sites.google.com/view/dawei-zhou/home?authuser=0). During his M.S. degree at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), he was advised by [Prof. Yazhou Ren](https://yazhou-ren.github.io/) and closely worked with [Prof. Lifang He](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/faculty/lifang-he). His research generally lies in **data mining** and **machine learning**, with a particular focus on **graph learning** and unsupervised **multi-view/modal/graph learning**, as well as their applications in scientific domains, (e.g., 3D graph modeling for **metamaterials** and **molecules**, etc.), contributing to the comunity of **AI for science**.
