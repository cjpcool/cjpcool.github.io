## About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu/) since Aug. 2023, where I am advised by [Prof. Dawei Zhou](https://sites.google.com/view/dawei-zhou/home?authuser=0) in [VLOG Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/dawei-zhou/vlog-lab).
During my M.S. degree at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), I was fortunately advised by [Prof. Yazhou Ren](https://yazhou-ren.github.io/) and [Prof. Lifang He](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/faculty/lifang-he) on the topic of multi-view/graph self-supervised learning.

Generally, my research lies in **data mining** and **machine learning**, with a particular focus on self-/un-supervised **multi-modal/view/graph learning**. and **Agentic LLMs**. I also seek to apply my research to scientific domains, such as 3D graph modeling of **metamaterials** and **molecules**, contributing to the broader community of **AI for science**. *To date, my work has led to multiple publications in top-tier venues, including KDD, AAAI, TNNLS, ICML, NAACL, etc., spanning machine learning, language models, and scientific discovery.*
Some major results are as follows (with overlap across domains):
* **Agentic LLMs** (Preprints'25: LinguaMate, ChemBOMAS) paves the way for collaboration between knowledge-driven agents and data-driven agents by exploring symbolic-driven latent optimization and finetuned LLM with Bayesian optimization.
* **Multi-view/modal learning** (ICML'25, AAAI'23, AAAI'24, ICONIP'22) studies unsupervised multi-view/modal alignment and collaboration mechanisms for clustering and generative tasks.
* **Graph learning/generation** (INS'24, TNNLS'25) develops methods for graph semantic extraction and specification-aware variational inference for graph generation.
* **Applications on Molecular and Material Science** (KDD'25, ICML'25, IJCAI'24) investigates how the advanced LLMs and generative models can be integrated with domain-specific knowledge for molecule and material modeling.
